# Code of Conduct

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the expectation community. Let's build something amazing together.

## Our Philosophy

We're here to create great statistical tools while having fun and learning from each other. The best ideas come when people feel comfortable being themselves and sharing their thoughts openly.

## The Short Version

- Be kind and patient
- Help others learn and grow
- Remember that everyone was a beginner once
- Focus on building cool stuff together
- Treat everyone with respect, regardless of their experience level
- Keep discussions constructive and positive

## The Slightly Longer Version

### What We Love to See

- Helping others debug their problems
- Sharing knowledge and resources
- Constructive feedback delivered with kindness
- Questions of all levels - no question is too basic!
- Creative ideas and suggestions
- Celebrating each other's successes
- Learning from mistakes together

### What We'd Rather Not See

- Making fun of others' mistakes or knowledge gaps
- Aggressive or hostile comments
- Discriminatory jokes or language
- Unwelcome personal attention
- Spamming or trolling
- Public or private harassment

## How We Build Together

- **Be Patient**: Some concepts in probability theory and statistics can be tricky. Take time to explain things clearly.
- **Be Curious**: Ask questions, explore ideas, and learn from others.
- **Be Helpful**: If you see someone struggling with something you understand, lend a hand.
- **Be Open-minded**: There's often more than one way to solve a problem.
- **Be Collaborative**: The best solutions often come from working together.

## When Things Go Wrong

If you see or experience any behavior that makes you uncomfortable:

1. If you feel comfortable, try addressing it directly with the person involved - they might not realize how their behavior affects others.
2. If that doesn't work or you're not comfortable doing so, reach out to the maintainers.
3. We'll listen, take your concern seriously, and work together to resolve the situation.

## The Fun Part

Remember, we're all here because we love building cool stuff with statistics and probability! Let's make this a community where everyone feels welcome to contribute, learn, and grow together.

## Questions?

Not sure about something? Just ask! We're all here to help each other succeed.
